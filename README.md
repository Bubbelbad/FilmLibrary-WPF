# Movie Library - WPF

This application should let the user browse movies for inspiration. The user should be able to save the movies to different lists, like favorites and watch list.

I want the user to be able to browse films without being logged in, but also to create an account for saving the films in lists etc. Maybe add comments too. 

Now I don't know the how's of all this just yet. But I hope this will be an on going project that I can also update during my database course! The options I'm looking at is either taking the imformation from the web (imdb) or using a local database. 

It might be that I change my goals when I know more, but this is the initial idea.



## Features (that are yet to be implemented)

- Saving the objects in different lists and localy
- Getting data from database or the web
- Live previews
- Creating account for better experience
- Light/dark mode toggle
