# Movie Library - WPF

This application should let the user browse movies for inspiration. The user should be able to save the movies to different lists, like 'favorites' and 'watch later'.

First I thought I'd use API's to get the data, but since I need to practice MySQL and database connection I am changing the program to use that instead.
It might be that I change my goals when I know more, but this is the idea!

## Features so far
- Log In window and Sign up window that allows a user to log in (with a nice background blur effect on background)
- When you log in, you get either admin privileges or ordinary user privilege to edit database
- Menu for logged in user where you select your view (most chioces not implemented yet though)
- Importing users and movies from the database

## Features that are yet to be

- Saving the movie-objects in different lists (watch later, favourites etc.)
- Getting and storing the data in SQL
- Sorting the movies in various ways (lenght, category, etc.)
- Scrollable feed for displaying movies in different categorys
