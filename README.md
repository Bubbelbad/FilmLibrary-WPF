# Movie Library - WPF

This application should let the user browse movies for inspiration. The user should be able to save the movies to different lists, like favorites and watch list.

The user to be able to browse films without being logged in, but also to create an account for saving the films in lists etc. Maybe add comments too. 

Now I don't know how to use API, but I thought I'd lay the foundation of this app with users and login at least and add all the rest laters.  

It might be that I change my goals when I know more, but this is the initial idea.



## Features (that are yet to be implemented)

- Saving the objects in different lists and localy
- Getting data from API's
- Live previews
- Creating account for more features
- Light/dark mode toggle
